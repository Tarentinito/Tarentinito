- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tarentinito, that's not really my name, but hey, I do not know you yet!
- 👀 I’m interested in tons of stuff but right now I am focusing on a few things... Coding, programming, and drawing. I am freakishly original, don't i know it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Python, Pixel Art, and will probably give a shot at some Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this Video Game I am making... maybe?
- 📫 How to reach me is a mystery. You can try via GitHub tho.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him, They/them, take your pick. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Let me get back to you on this...
